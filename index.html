<h4 style="color: green;">What is a substatement function declaration?</h4>

<p>
JavaScript supports nested function declarations:
</p>

<pre>function outer() {
  function inner() { /* ... */ }
  // ...
}</pre>

<p>
But according to the standard, nested function declarations are only
allowed to appear at the outermost level of their parent function (or
script). If you nest a function declaration inside of another
statement, you've waded into non-standard territory:
</p>

<pre>{
  // ...
  function f() { /* ... */ } // this is non-standard JavaScript!
  // ...
}</pre>

<p>
The function <tt>f</tt> is a <i>substatement function declaration</i>:
it is a function declaration that appears inside a substatement of its
parent function, rather than at its parent function's top level. Not
only is this non-standard, but <i>different JavaScript engines exhibit
different behavior</i> for this kind of code.
</p>

<h4 style="color: blue;">What does this browser do?</h4>

<p>
This browser exhibits <b><span id="answer"></span></b>
scoping semantics for function declarations that are nested
within substatements of their parent function or script.
</p>

<h4 style="color: orange;">What does all this mean?</h4>

<dl>
<dt><b>static scoping</b></dt>
<dd>
the function is in its scope regardless of whether its declaration is
executed.
</dd>
<dt><b>dynamic scoping</b></dt>
<dd>
the function is added into its scope during execution, and only after
its declaration is executed.
</dd>

<dt><b>function-local scoping</b></dt>
<dd>
the function's scope extends across its entire containing function (it
is "hoisted" to its parent function's top level).
</dd>

<dt><b>block-local scoping</b></dt>
<dd>
the function's scope extends across its containing block.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4 style="color: purple;">Why should I care?</h4>

<p>
First of all, you should really care about your code behaving the same
across different browsers!  Second of all, dynamic scope is widely
understood to be a bad thing. It has bad performance, and is harder to
use correctly without accidentally introducing strange and subtle
bugs.  Firefox is the only browser that uses dynamic scoping for
substatement function declarations, but Mozilla is considering trying
to change this.
</p>

<p>
In the
future, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Strict_mode">strict
mode</a> JavaScript will provide block-local scoping for substatement
function declarations. So you should beware of depending on the
hoisting of function scope, since migrating code to strict mode could
change its behavior.
